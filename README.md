# Traffic-Light-Controller
SystemVerilog project implementing a traffic light controller with pedestrian button functionality. The design manages the traffic light cycles for vehicles and ensures safe pedestrian crossing using a finite state machine (FSM) for precise and efficient control. Developed for testing on the FPGA board XC7S50CSGA324-1.
